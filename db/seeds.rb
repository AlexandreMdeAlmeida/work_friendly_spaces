# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)
# puts 'Creating 5 fake users..'
# user1 = User.new(first_name: "", last_name: "", email: "", password: "", phone_number: "", address: "")
# user1.save!
# user2 = User.new(first_name: "", last_name: "", email: "", password: "", phone_number: "", address: "")
# user2.save!
# user3 = User.new(first_name: "", last_name: "", email: "", password: "", phone_number: "", address: "")
# user3.save!
# user4 = User.new(first_name: "", last_name: "", email: "", password: "", phone_number: "", address: "")
